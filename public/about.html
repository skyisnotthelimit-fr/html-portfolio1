<p>As a Senior Engineer, a leading business leadership service provider, I apply my versatile skillset to a range of projects across various sectors, such as Information Technology, and Construction.</p>
<p>I excel in fast-paced environments where change is the norm, and I can think on my feet and pivot as needed to meet the project objectives and deadlines. I have successfully delivered multiple projects, where I managed the project schedule, budget, and quality, and coordinated with software engineers, developers, and other key stakeholders.</p>
<p>I graduated from University of Nottingham with a BEng in Mechanical, Materials & Manufacturing Engineering (Hons) in 2020, where I honed my technical and analytical skills, as well as my communication and teamwork abilities.</p>
<p>I also completed several online courses and certifications in Project Management, SQL programming, and 3D CAD, to enhance my professional development and expand my knowledge base. I am passionate about learning new things and challenging myself, and I am always eager to take on new opportunities and responsibilities. In my spare time, I enjoy rock climbing and practicing Brazilian jiu-jitsu, which keep me physically and mentally fit, and help me maintain a positive outlook.</p>
